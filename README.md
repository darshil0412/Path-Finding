## Overview
Pathfinding is a classic problem in computer science, and this program provides a visual representation of two popular pathfinding algorithms - Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm. Users can interactively create mazes, set start and target points, and observe how these algorithms find the shortest path.

## Features
1. **Interactive Interface:** Set start and target points, create walls, and observe the algorithm execution in real-time.
2. **Random Maze Generation:** Quickly generate random mazes to test the algorithms.
3. **Reset Functionality:** Reset the grid to start a new configuration.
4. **Toggle Wall Mode:** Toggle between setting start/target points and creating/removing walls.
5. **Algorithm Visualization:** Visualize the execution of Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualization.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the Python script.
   ```bash
   python pathfinding_visualization.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the visualization.

## File Structure
